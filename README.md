## Documentation

Visit [AuraUI](https://auraui.com/components) for the main auraUI documentation. Icons are an integral part of the library, and you‚Äôll find icon usage examples there as well.

## Key Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Works hand-in-hand with auraUI‚Äôs components and styles.
- **Scalable Vector Graphics**: SVG-based icons to ensure top-notch quality on all screen sizes.
- **Easy Import**: Import only the icons you need or bulk-load the entire set.
- **Consistent Design**: Matches auraUI‚Äôs design language for a professional look.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @auralabs/aura-icons
# or
yarn add @auralabs/aura-icons
```

_(Note: Make sure you have the main auraUI library installed if you want to fully leverage auraUI‚Äôs ecosystem.)_

## Usage

1. **Import an Icon**

   ```jsx
   import { ChatAddIcon } from "@auralabs/aura-icons";

   function MyComponent() {
     return <ChatAddIcon className="text-gray-800 w-6 h-6" />;
   }
   ```

2. **Customize**
   - Apply Tailwind classes (or your own CSS) to set size, color, etc.
   - Icons are lightweight and easily styled for any brand requirement.

3. **Explore More Icons**
